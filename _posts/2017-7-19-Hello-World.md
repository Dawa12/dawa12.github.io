title: Hello World!
---

Hello World! I'm a Web Developer living in Queens, NY. I'm a recent bootcamp grad and have a background in advertising and marketing. 

I'm very excited to setup this blog. I've been meaning to use jekyll for a while to setup an easy to use blog. I'm currently job hunting for technical roles, and I'd like to use this forum to document my thoughts on web dev and share advice for others making a career transition into a technical role! Look out for future posts!
